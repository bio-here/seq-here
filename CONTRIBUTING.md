3. **Switch to the dev branch** - `git checkout dev` (all development must be based on the dev branch)
4. **Create a feature branch** - `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. **Make changes** - Write code and commit your changes
6. **Push to your repository** - `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. **Create a Pull Request** - Make sure your target is the **`dev` branch** of the original repository

- Maintain consistent code style
- Add tests and documentation when necessary
- Clearly describe your changes and purpose in your PR description

## Review Process

Maintainers will review your PR and may suggest modifications. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `dev` branch and incorporated into the main branch during the next release.
